# S24-Mechatronics-Daft-Punks-
Repo containing the ROS packages and Arduino Scripts for Team 2 Daft Punk's Spidey Robot

catkin_ws.zip contains all ROS files needed to run the Spidey Robot as currently configured, as well instructions on how to start the robot. More details can be found it its internal README document.

arduino_x_leg_control_script files contain the arduino code to control the approprate legs, with pin assignments altered to reflect the proper arduino. 
  - arduino_1_leg_control_script.ino should be flashed to the Arduino Leonardo responsible for controlling the motors of legs 1 and 2.
  - arduino_2_leg_control_script.ino should be flashed to the Arduino Uno responsible for controlling the motors of legs 3 and 4.
  - arduino_3_leg_control_script.ino should be flashed to the Arduino Uno responsible for controlling the motors of legs 5 and 6.
